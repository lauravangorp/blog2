I'm a Graphic Design student from Antwerp, Belgium. During my free time I enjoy
roaming around the internet discovering other artist. This being artists specialized in digital art,
sculptures, street and public art, murals and more. On this blog you can find all the artists who inspired me and their works. This blog was also made to showcase my knowledge in 11ty, CSS, HTML and more.
