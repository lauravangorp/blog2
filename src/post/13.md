<br> Daniel Arsham has just unveiled his latest project with Nintendo’s Pokémon franchise. Following the craze of shadowless Charizard TCG cards, the artists new crystalized artwork takes the form of a base set 1st edition Charizard (the first edition insignia has been obscured by the Arsham’s signature crystalized erosion technique) in a resin and crystal sculpture.

<br> Standing at 30.48 cm in height and weighing 2.4kg, Arsham comments, “This edition is modeled after the 1st edition Charizard Holo which is the most iconic and rare card in the Pokémon Card Universe.” Limited to 500 examples, the card sculpture comes with handling gloves and is authenticated. No price has been set, but expect it to drop on Friday 12:00 p.m. EST at Daniel Arsham Shop.
